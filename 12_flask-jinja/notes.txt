Initial notes:
* Now importing render_template as well as Flask
* In model_tmplt.html there is jinja code
* 2 different app.route() statements

Prediction:
* If render_template is not imported, the page will not be rendered (Q0)
* First webpage will open "no hablo queso" as usual
* Adding "/my_foist_template" to the url will open the model_tmplt.html 
  with some sort of jinja processing -> we think it will print the numbers in the coll list (Q1)
* In the model_tmplt.html file, foo and collection represent variables. 
  Those variables are assigned values in the return statement on line 16 of app.py (Q2)

Results:
* Removing render_template did stop the page from rendering
* First webpage was the same as usual
* When "/my_foist_template" was added, it did open the template and the numbers from coll were
  printed with one number on each line. 
* The values in the return line in app.py did in fact correspond with variables
