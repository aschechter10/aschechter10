Notes on tablified.html:
* The jinja2 documentation is almost as bad as the syntax

Notes on egoless programming: 
* Dragos likes having friends :) (social interaction is vital)
* Programs are objective 
* Constructive criticism good
* Harder to find errors when you're alone - others can help (duck debugging)
* Don't be aggresive when you find errors
