K08 - Cross Pollination and Virtual Insanity: investigate $ -m venv ~/myherozero
2020-10-05

- the venv module is used to create "virtual environments"
- virtual environments contain a python installation for a particular version of Python and additional packages
- these virtual environments have their own directories that can be differentiated with those of the system
- the ~/myherozero creates a directory where the virtual environment is in this case
- running the command will create a target directory if a parent directory does not exist and places a
  pyvenv.cfg file in it
- virtual enivronments need to be activated after creation
