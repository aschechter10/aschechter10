Lecture -1: Welcome to M001
* Thanks


Lecture 0: What is the MongoDB database?
* MongoDB is a no SQL, document based database. It uses collections which contain documents to store data rather than tables with rows and columns.
* Collection - an organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.


Lecture 1: What is a document in MongoDB?
* Document - a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.
* Field - a unique identifier for a datapoint.
* Value - data related to a given identifier.
* A database contains many collections which contain documents (field/value pairs), usually with common fields between documents


Lecture 2: What is MongoDB Atlas?
* Atlas is a cloud database with MongoDB at its core
* Atlas users deploy clusters (groups of servers) that store your data
* Replica Set - a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. 
* Instance - a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case it is the MongoDB database.
* Why Atlas?
   * Manages cluster creation
   * Run and maintain database deployment
   * Use cloud service provider of your choice
   * Experiment with new MongoDB features 


Lab 0: Create and deploy an Atlas server
* Free version limited to 512MB of data and can only be on the cloud
* Uses a few server providers around the world. You choose the one that is closest to you


Lecture 3: Atlas User Interface Overview
* Not much here, coming back to realms and charts later
* Click on the collections button to access collections


Lecture 4: Introducing the in-browser IDE
* Some of the work and testing will be done in an in-browser IDE
* Has a file browser on the left, terminal and test results to see how you did


Lab 1: Connect to your Atlas cluster
* Connect to the mongo shell using the in-browser IDE
   * Copy the connection link into the shell and replace <dbname> with the name of your database
   * Then enter your password and you should have access to the shell
