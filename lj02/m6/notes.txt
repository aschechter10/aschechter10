Lecture 0: Atlas features
* Indexes tab shows indexes, allows you to drop them, see who made them and analyze usage
* The schema and anti-pattern tab will provide you with solid analysis of your data model once you have queried against your data enough times
* The aggregation tab allows you to build aggregation pipelines with the GUI


Lecture 1: Atlas products and options

* Chart allows you to visualize your data through graphs and charts.


Lecture 2: What is MongoDB Compass?
* Compass is MongoDB's Graphical User Interface Product.
* Never touch admin, config or local, unless support tells you to
* Compass allows you to see the databases and all of their statistics
   * Number of documents, total document size, average document size etc.
* You can export data to specific language types
* Schema allows you to see information about your data, including when they were created and changed.
   * Also allows you to see how the files were acquired, sorted by date, or even values.
* Index allows you to choose default indexes, along with a lot of customizability.


Lecture 3: What is MongoDB Compass? (Part 2)
* Indexes can be used to organize data
* The more criteria you use the less useful it becomes
* You can write code to organize your data further, and even check it for issues
   * This includes making sure certain values are strings.
* Instructor is way more interested in maps than we are apparently
