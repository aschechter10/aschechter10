Lecture 1: Query Operators - Comparison
* Query operators let us find data in different ways
* Ex: comparison operators ($eq for =, $neq for !=, $gt for >, $lte for <=, etc.)
   * Used in the format { <field>: { <operator>: <value> } }
* In mongo shell, use query operators with the find() method
* Equals operator is implicit in certain cases
   * { “usertype”: { “$eq”: “Customer: } } is the same as { “usertype”: “Customer” }
   * Equals operator is used as the default operator when one isn’t specified


Lecture 2: Query Operators - Logic
* $and finds the documents that meet all the query clauses
* $or finds documents that meet at least one of the query clauses
* $nor find documents that don’t meet any of the clauses
* $not negates the clauses


* $and, $or, $nor use the syntax { <operator>: [{statement1}, {statement2}, … ]}
* $not uses the syntax {$not: {statement}}


* $and is used as default operator when one isn’t specified
* Statements can just be separated by commas
* Use explicit $and when using the same operator more than once in a query
