K0p - Simple Path to Greatness: answer questions from a python file
2020-10-08

Q0: In java, we used a the same syntax to call a function and pass an argument. Here it's calling Flask and passing argument __name__

Q1: We have only seen backslash for navigating into directories/specifying a path

Q2: We believe this will print to the terminal. Although it's possible it could print to the web page itself (that's just an educated guess as we know that Flask is a web framework).

Q3a: We believe it will print the name of the file (app.py)

Q3b: We don't think it will appear anywhere. Returning a value for a function doesn't usually print it unless you call the function with a print().

Q4: In java, the dot operator was used to call functions in other files/libraries. In this case, app.run() might be calling the run() function in a different file called app



Notes after running:
* "No hablo queso!" is printed in the body of the html file. Not printed in terminal
* __main__ is printed in the terminal. Clearly has something to do with how we call the main function in python. Assuming __name__ is always __main__ in a python file
