Initial notes:
* Foo (not foo.html) seems to have no file type

Prediction:
* Still going to print no hablo queso
* Navigating to foo.html through the link /static/foo.html will present the foo.html webpage
* Not sure what was going to happen with foo (not html)

Results:
* Still printed no hablo queso
* Navigating to foo.html did present the webpage
* When Navigating to foo, it tries to download the foo file (still not sure of file type)
